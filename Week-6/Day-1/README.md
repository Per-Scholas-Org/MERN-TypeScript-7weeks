# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 6 - Day 1 - MERN Cyber Security

_Prerequisite Knowledge: Node.js, React and Redux w/ TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Sessions, HTTP Methods_

_Exercise Goals: Recognize that SQL Injection, Broken Authentication, and Session Management are the top threats to your application. Learn how to counter those threats with the application of security dependencies and other best practices._

### MVP

Apply Helmet Middleware

Use any MERN w/ Redux and TypeScript application that you've already developed. Apply the Helmet middleware by following the documentation found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet). This will help you to secure your application against a wide variety of attacks and is very much a necessity for any serious web application.

### _Optional_ Stretch Goal

Protect Against CSRF Attacks with CSURF and Express-Session

Apply the [csruf middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csurf) by following the documentation and the security guide found [here](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html). These resources will help you to secure your application against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other attacks.

### _Optional_ SUPER Stretch Goal

OWASP Cheat Sheet

Become a Cyber Security Expert and work the complete OWASP Cheat Sheet! This will help you to understand cyber security best practices and advanced topics for your application. Also, you'd earn some *serious* bragging rights during a technical interview! You can find a sample cheat sheet [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html).
