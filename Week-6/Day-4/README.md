# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 6 - Day 4 - Continuous Delivery and Deployment

*Prerequisite Knowledge: Node.js, React and Redux w/ TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Security Best Practices, Continuous Integration*

*Exercise Goals: Understand the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment. Gain confidence in adding features to your application while using CD best practices in an agile environment.*

### MVP
Automated Continuous Deployment

After this week, you should have a MERN w/ TypeScript application that is deployed to a production environment on Heroku using Continuous Integration. Presently, you are adding features to your application manually as continuous delivery via GitHub/Heroku. Today, our challenge is to add automated Continuous Deployment to your application. Configure your application so that the newest version is deployed to production automatically every 24 hours.

Try it on your own first!

If you get stuck then you can find help in the [Handling Continuous Integration And Delivery With GitHub Actions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/handling-continuous-integration-delivery-github-actions/).

### *Optional* Stretch Goal
Add React-Bootstrap

Up until now, we've focused mainly on the typing and syntax of our application. We've also learned how to use React and Redux to create a simple front-end. It is important to learn how to use Bootstrap to create a more complex front-end.

You can check out the React-Bootstrap [documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/) or this video [YouTube - The Nerdy Canuck - React & Bootstrap with Reactstrap & Typescript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkvuQoOGvsw) to learn how to use Bootstrap in your React w/ TypeScript application.

Note all of your strict type declarations, continuous integration best practices, and continuous deployment implementations are enterprise level skills and you should be very proud of yourself for completing this course! =)
