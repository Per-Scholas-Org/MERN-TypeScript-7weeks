# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 6 - Day 2 - Single Sign On and Environment Variables

_Prerequisite Knowledge: Node.js, React and Redux w/ TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Sessions, HTTP Methods_

_Exercise Goals: Learn how to implement single sign on OAuth2.0 into your MERN w/ TypeScript application._

### MVP

Add OAuth2.0

Yesterday, we added Helmet and other security middleware to our fullstack MERN w/ TypeScript application. Today, you should implement OAuth2.0 to that same application allowing for Google Single Sign On authorization. 

### _Optional_ Stretch Goal

Hide All Environmental Variables

Check that all of your environmental variables are hidden from the public. For example, your MongoDB Atlas username and password should be hidden.

### _Optional_ SUPER Stretch Goal

Add Facebook Sign On

Practice using professional develops Software Development Kit (SDK) to integrate Facebook Sign On into your application. You can find it the documentation for Facebook's OAuth2.0 SDK [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/).
