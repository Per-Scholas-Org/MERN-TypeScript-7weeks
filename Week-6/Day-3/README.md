# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 6 - Day 3 - Continuous Integration

*Prerequisite Knowledge: Node.js, React and Redux w/ TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Security Best Practices, Single Sign On Implementation*

*Exercise Goals: Deliver a fullstack web application based on MERN w/ TypeScript technologies that employs continuous integration principles like unit testing and logging changes into it's deployment.*

### MVP
Implement Continuous Integration

Follow the detailed instructions found at this [Blog by Max Ivanox - Code and Security Checks in TypeScript with GitHub Actions](https://www.maxivanov.io/code-and-security-checks-in-typescript-projects-with-github-actions/) to implement a continuous integration pipeline into your deployed fullstack application using Github Actions.

### *Optional* Stretch Goal
Establish CHANGELOG.md

Begin tracking the changes made to your deployed application by creating a CHANGELOG.md file. You can find instructions on how to do so at [FreeCodeCamp - Gael Thomas - What is a Changelog and How to Generate it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-git-what-is-a-changelog-and-how-to-generate-it/).
