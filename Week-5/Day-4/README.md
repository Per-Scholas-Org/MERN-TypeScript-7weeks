# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 5 - Day 4 - Heroku Deployment

_Prerequisite Knowledge: HTTP Methods, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB connection (Mongoose), RESTful API Principles, React w/ TypeScript_

_Exercise Goals: Deploy a RESTful API through the Heroku PaaS written in a NodeJS runtime environment, using Express middleware, MongoDB Atlas for data persistence, and TypeScript for strongly typed JavaScript._

### MVP

Deployed API

Create a RESTful API deployed to Heroku useing NodeJS and Express with TypeScript technologies. The API should be able to:

<br /> 

    1. Create a new user
<br />

    2. Get a user by ID

<br />

    3. Get all users

<br />

    4. Update a user by ID

<br />

    5. Delete a user by ID

<br />

### _Optional_ Stretch Goal

Front-end

Add a React w/ TypeScript frontend to the API.

### _Optional_ SUPER Stretch Goal

Add Routing to Front-end

Use `react-router-dom` to add routing to the frontend. Be creative with the routes! However, typical routes would be like a Home page, About page, Contact page, etc.
