# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 5 - Day 3 - Data Encryption

*Prerequisite Knowledge: NodeJS, Express, TypeScript, Test Driven Development, React and Redux w/ TypeScript*

*Exercise Goals: Apply prior knowledge of NodeJS, Express, and TypeScript to create secure web applications using JSON Web Tokens and BCrypt password hashing.*

### MVP
Create RESTful API with JSON Web Tokens and BCrypt Hashing

Coding sample found at [GitHub - whutchinson98 - node-express-auth-skeleton ](https://github.com/whutchinson98/node-express-auth-skeleton). 

Please create a RESTful API that requires JWT authentication and BCrypt password hasing. There should a route to create a new user, a route to login that accepts a username and password and returns a JWT token. The JWT token should be valid for 1 hour.

No frontend/client is required for MVP. Functionality should be testable via Postman. 

### *Optional* Stretch Goal
Create a React Application with TypeScript

Create a React application that requires JWT authentication. The application should have a login page that accepts a username and password and returns a JWT token. After logging in, users should be redirected to a page that displays the user's username.

### *Optional* SUPER Stretch Goal
Add Redux to the React Application
