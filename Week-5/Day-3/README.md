# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 5 - Day 3 - MongoDB Database

*Prerequisite Knowledge: HTTP Methods, RESTful API Principles, Data Persistence, Basic Security (JWT and BCrypt), React and Redux w/ TypeScript*

*Exercise Goals: Store persistent data in the cloud that can be fetched and manipulated using HTTP methods.*

### MVP
NodeJS Express TypeScript API connected to MongoDB

Coding demonstration found at [YouTube - Vince Tech - Typescript Mongoose and MongoDB Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2aRRH1iug). 

Please follow the tutorial found at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld2aRRH1iug) link to create a simple NodeJS Express TypeScript API connected to MongoDB. You should be able to successfully test this API with Postman.

### *Optional* Stretch Goal
Add authentication to the API

Refer to yesterday's lesson to add JWT and BCrypt to the API. You should be able to successfully test this API with Postman. Saved passwords should be hashed and stored in the database. Users should be able to login and receive a JWT token.

### *Optional* SUPER Stretch Goal
Add a React frontend to the API

Create a React frontend to the API. You should be able to render data in the browser's window.
