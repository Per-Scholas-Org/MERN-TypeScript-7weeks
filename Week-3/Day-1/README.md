# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 3 - Day 1

*Prerequisite Knowledge: GitHub, downloading repositories, installing dependecies.*

*Exercise Goals: Become intiially familiar with both GitHub and a basic React with TypeScript application.*

Coding demonstration found at [YouTube - Laith Harb - React with TypeScript Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKcJxF0lAU)

### MVP
Follow these steps to get this repository working in your local environment.
1. Download repository.
2. Open command terminal and navigate to MERN-TypeScript-7Weeks/Week-3/Day-1
3. Type `npm install` into the command line to install of the necessary dependencies locally.
4. Type `npm start` into the command line to launch a React with TypeScript template.

### Stretch Goal
Watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKcJxF0lAU) and code along. Final code can be found [here](https://github.com/harblaith7/React-With-TypeScript-Crash-Course). Actively coding along and learning from your own mistakes is the best way to use this kind of content! =) 

### SUPER Stretch Goal
Add the *HEIGHT* of each of the basketball players from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKcJxF0lAU) to the interface and render it in the browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
