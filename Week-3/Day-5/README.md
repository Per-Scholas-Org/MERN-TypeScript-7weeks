Coding Challenge: Grocery List

### Required MVP

Create a simple Grocery List application. Your user interface should include at least one input field that takes a string. It should also have a submit button to handle the value change. Users should be able to add multiple items to an array. That array of items should render for users to read.

Typescript not required.

### *Optional* Stretch Goal

0. Use Typescript

1. Create another way for a user to add an item to the grocery list: 

 - Add a second input field that is a <ins>dropdown</ins> with different categories of items to select like "beef", "fruit", etc. Users should be able to select that item's category from the dropdown and then click a submit button to add it to the list. **This is another way to add an item in addition to adding an item via the input box**.
    - **Stretch goal for the stretch goal:** Give the items from the dropdown a prices, description, etc.

2. Create a dropdown to filter the grocery list. For example, only show vegetables.

3. Add routing. Maybe being able to click on an item on the list goes to a "details" page where the user can add notes. 

4. Add checkboxes for if an item is "done" or not. 

### *Optional* SUPER Stretch Goal

Make an API fetch request to [any APi](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and render the data in the browser.
