Coding Challenge: Grocery List

### MVP

Create a simple Grocery List application. Your user interface should include at least one input field that takes a string. It should also have a submit button to handle the value change. Users should be able to add multiple items to an array. That array of items should render for users to read.

### Stretch Goal

Add a second input field that is a <ins>dropdown</ins> with different categories of items to select like "beef", "fruit", etc. Use should be able to input a string, select that item's category from the dropdown, and then click a submit button to add it to the list. 

### SUPER Stretch Goal

Make an API fetch request to [any APi](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and render the data in the browser.
