# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 3 - Day 4
Coding demonstration found at [YouTube - Codevolution - React TypeScript Webpack Setup from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elpu7CIuqjY&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwiWPS2RO3BKotLRfgg_8WEo).

### MVP

*Prerequisite Knowledge: installing node packages, configuring webpack, crafting components, and React navigation with react-router-dom.*

Download the basic HTML file and begin importing your important libraries like Babel, Webpack, React, and TypeScript. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elpu7CIuqjY&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwiWPS2RO3BKotLRfgg_8WEo) to create a React with TypeScript template from scratch! 

### Stretch Goal
Use prior exercises to add functionality to your newly created template. It could be a To-do list, login form, blog, or anything your imagination can come up with! Just have some fun and gain some experience inputting variables and manipulating state.

### SUPER Stretch Goal
Add routing contained within a Navigation bar at the top of the page with at least three different pages - home, your "stretch goal" functionality, and anything else like an about page etc. Please remember that each lesson is designed to build upon the last and you're welcome to use your previous resources within the context of your from scratch template! =)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
