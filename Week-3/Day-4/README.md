# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 3 - Day 4

*Prerequisite Knowledge: installing node packages, crafting components, and React navigation with react-router-dom.*

*Exercise Goals: Gain more detailed knowledge of the architecture of a React with TypeScript application by <ins>not</ins> relying upon the the `npx create-react-app --template typescript` script for initial project scaffolding.*

Coding demonstration found at [YouTube - Codevolution - React TypeScript Webpack Setup from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elpu7CIuqjY&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwiWPS2RO3BKotLRfgg_8WEo).

### MVP

Download the basic HTML file and begin importing your important libraries like Babel, Webpack, React, and TypeScript. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elpu7CIuqjY&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwiWPS2RO3BKotLRfgg_8WEo) to create a React with TypeScript template from scratch! 

### Stretch Goal
Use prior exercises to add functionality to your newly created template. It could be a To-do list, consume an API, take data as a login form, blog, or anything your imagination can come up with! Just have some fun and gain some experience inputting variables and manipulating state.

### SUPER Stretch Goal
Add routing contained within a Navigation bar at the top of the page with at least three different pages - home, your "stretch goal" functionality, and anything else like an about page etc. Please remember that each lesson is designed to build upon the last and you're welcome to use your previous resources within the context of your from scratch template! =)
