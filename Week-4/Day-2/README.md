# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 4 - Day 4 - React Redux

*Prerequisite Knowledge: GitHub, TypeScript, React w/ TypeScript, Basic State Management*

*Exercise Goals: Introduce the most popular third party library for managing state with React applications - Redux! Learners should be able to create a React w/ TypeScript and React Redux boilerplate for practical applications. Additionally, they should complete the stretch goal of adding real functionality to the application.*

### MVP
Create React w/ Redux and TypeScript Boilerplate!  

Coding demonstration found at [FreeCodeCamp - Ibrahima Ndaw - How to Use Redux in Your React TypeScript App](https://github.com/PavelKrokhmal/react-redux-typescript-course).

Please follow the instructions found at [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-redux-in-your-react-typescript-app/) link to build your first React with Redux and TypeScript application. It's important to get this practice so that you have a great understanding of what things are and where they go.

### Stretch Goal
Create a Todo List! 

Coding demonstration found at [GitHub - PavelKrokhmal - React w/ Redux and TypeScript Todo Application](https://github.com/PavelKrokhmal/react-redux-typescript-course).

Now that you have a working application with React, Redux, and TypeScript - it's time to add some real functionality! You can follow [this](https://github.com/PavelKrokhmal/react-redux-typescript-course) link to a working code sample if you need help.

### SUPER Stretch Goal
Add another functionality to your application from last week's lessons! This could includ routing from one page to the next, fetching data from an API, or submitting data using a form. Be creative, have fun, and show us what you've got! =)
