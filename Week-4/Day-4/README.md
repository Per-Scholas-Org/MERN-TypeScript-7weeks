# MERN-TypeScript-7weeks

## Week 4 - Day 4

*Prerequisite Knowledge: React with TypeScript, NodeJS with TypeScript*

*Exercise Goals: Become familiar with Test Driven Development (TDD) by interacting with a React with Redux and TypeScript application and gain even more expertise by using Jest to perform tests within a NodeJS developmental environment.*

### MVP
Test React Components

Coding demonstration found at [PluralSight - Kamran Ayub - How to Test React Components in TypeScript](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-test-react-components-in-typescript).

Please follow the instructions found at [this](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-test-react-components-in-typescript) link to create a basic login form with testing using React w/ TypeScript and Jest. 

### *Optional* Stretch Goal
Add Redux!

Add Redux to this application to further enhance separation of concerns.

### *Optional* SUPER Stretch Goal
Add a NodeJS API with Jest Testing

Use [this boilerplate](https://github.com/Per-Scholas-Org/node-typescript-boilerplate) to create a RESTful API with unit testing that receives data from your form.
